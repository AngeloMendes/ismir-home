## Women in Music Information Retrieval (WiMIR)

**WiMIR** is a group of people dedicated to promoting the role of, and
increasing opportunities for, women in the MIR field. We meet to socialize,
share information, and discuss in an informal setting, with the goal of building
a community around women in our field.

WiMIR has held annual meetings at the ISMIR conference since 2012 in Porto. The
meetings have had a high turnout of both female and male attendees. A number
of important issues ranging from mentorship, conference support, to improving
the representativeness of women researchers in the community were discussed. Photos
from the WiMIR meeting at ISMIR 2014 can be
